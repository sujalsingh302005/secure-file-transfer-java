# secure-file-transfer-java

 **Project Overview

This project implements a secure file transfer system using Java socket programming with a client–server architecture.
It enables reliable and safe transmission of files between two systems over a network.

 **Objective

To design and develop a Java-based application that allows secure file sharing between a client and a server using network sockets and data streams.

 **Technologies Used

* Java
* Socket Programming
* Client–Server Architecture
* File Input/Output Streams
* Basic Security Concepts

**System Working

1. The server waits for incoming client connections on a specified port.
2. The client connects to the server using the server’s IP address and port number.
3. The client selects a file to transmit.
4. The file is transferred through data streams over the network connection.
5. The server receives the file and stores it locally.

 **How to Run the Project

 *Compilation

bash
javac Server.java
javac Client.java

*Run Server

bash
java Server

* Run Client

bash
java Client

 **Applications

* Secure document sharing within organizations
* Internal company file transfer systems
* Network-based file communication
* Distributed computing environments

**Future Enhancements

* Integration of encryption techniques such as AES or RSA
* Graphical user interface using Java Swing or JavaFX
* Support for multiple simultaneous clients
* User authentication and access control mechanisms

**Video demonstration
